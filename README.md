# F1 Fantasy Leauge

This is a project for entertainment purposes only; Don't take any content seriously. In this application, people are allowed to upload their cars. I created it since we were tired of keeping track of our f1 fantasy league in google sheets.


## How to use
It's bootstrapped with NEXT.JS, and uses material-ui and Emotion for styling.

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
