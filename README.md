# F1 Fantasy Leauge

This is a project for entertainment purposes only, dont take any content seriously. I created it since we were tiered of keeping track of our f1 fantasy leauge in google sheets.


## How to use
It's bootstrapped with NEXT.JS, and uses material-ui and Emotion for styling.

Install it and run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
